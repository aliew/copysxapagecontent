# copysxapagecontent
This is a custom experience editor ribbon button command to copy a page's final layout definition which comprises all of its page property fields and its defined list of components (composite components such as carousels, accordions and tabs) and its datasources from the default language that is English to other configured languages within your Sitecore system.

The current module is compatible with Sitecore 9.0 Update 1 and Sitecore Experience Accelerator (SXA) 1.7 at the time of creation.

If you are using this module for any versions other than the Sitecore and SXA versions mentioned above, please conduct some thorough assessments and testing prior to using this module.
